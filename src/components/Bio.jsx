      Haiming Wang is a computational designer based in Los Angeles, operating in the realms of artificial intelligence, art, and architecture. His work includes chatMASS, an AI architectural massing ideator and exporter built in a game engine to empower architects to iterate on massing fast and intelligently; 3‑D‑printed pieces generated with AI and refined through down‑support techniques; a voxel‑based agentic architectural system written in JavaScript; and more. But the point isn’t the technology or the technical details—it’s just interesting to step into the uncharted and unearth the next nice thing..
